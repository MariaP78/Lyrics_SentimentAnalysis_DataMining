Echoes of your voice haunt my dreams
Your absence is a silent scream that echoes within
Tears fall silently, blurring yesterday's joy

Lyrics: Eternal Rain
Now I walk this path alone, where once we walked together
Love's tender flame has faded into the cold shadow of the past
In the garden of our love, the roses wilt and wither
Tears fall silently, blurring yesterday's joy
Your absence is a silent scream that echoes within
Echoes of your voice haunt my dreams
A single picture, a thousand shattered memories
Time stands still in the room where we laughed

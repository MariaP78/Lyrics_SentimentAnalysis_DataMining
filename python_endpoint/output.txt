Song: Dancing Symphony Like a lighthouse in the storm, your love is my guide Our love's a melody that echoes through the night Our story is written in the stars above Just like the stars belong to the night Every heartbeat calls your name in a whisper In your eyes, I find my tomorrow Hand in hand, heart to heart, our souls take flight In the symphony of life, your heart's my favorite note,

Song: Fading Dance Tonight, we're the kings and queens of the dance floor Surrender to the beat, and let the music take control Let the DJ be the architect of our escapade Celebrate the night as if there's no sunrise to meet Sway to the rhythm; let the moment be your guide The city's alive with the sound of the beat In the rhythm of the night, we find freedom With every pulse, our spirits are unified,

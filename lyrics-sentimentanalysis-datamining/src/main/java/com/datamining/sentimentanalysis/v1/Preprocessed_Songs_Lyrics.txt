in the rhythm of the night we find freedom


fading heartbeat
hand in hand heart to heart our souls take flight
in your eyes i find my tomorrow
our loves a melody that echoes through the night
like a lighthouse in the storm your love is my guide
every heartbeat calls your name in a whisper
in the symphony of life your hearts my favorite note
our story is written in the stars above
just like the stars belong to the night


thundering solitude
now i walk this path alone where once we walked together
a single picture a thousand shattered memories
echoes of your voice haunt my dreams
your absence is a silent scream that echoes within
tears fall silently blurring yesterdays joy
loves tender flame has faded into the cold shadow of the past
time stands still in the room where we laughed
in the garden of our love the roses wilt and wither


whispering serenade
just like the stars belong to the night
in your eyes i find my tomorrow
hand in hand heart to heart our souls take flight
every heartbeat calls your name in a whisper
in the symphony of life your hearts my favorite note
our loves a melody that echoes through the night
like a lighthouse in the storm your love is my guide
our story is written in the stars above


shattered vibe
the citys alive with the sound of the beat
surrender to the beat and let the music take control
let the dj be the architect of our escapade
with every pulse our spirits are unified
in the rhythm of the night we find freedom
celebrate the night as if theres no sunrise to meet
tonight were the kings and queens of the dance floor
sway to the rhythm let the moment be your guide


thundering rhythm
surrender to the beat and let the music take control
the citys alive with the sound of the beat

in the rhythm of the night we find freedom
with every pulse our spirits are unified
sway to the rhythm let the moment be your guide
celebrate the night as if theres no sunrise to meet


eternal promises
our loves a melody that echoes through the night
every heartbeat calls your name in a whisper
our story is written in the stars above
in the symphony of life your hearts my favorite note
like a lighthouse in the storm your love is my guide
just like the stars belong to the night
in your eyes i find my tomorrow
hand in hand heart to heart our souls take flight

we are the authors of our destiny the painters of our dreams
dreams take flight on the wings of courage
forge your path with the iron of your will and the fire of your heart

in the canvas of the night sky your lights the brightest star
stand tall against the roaring wind
every challenge is a melody of triumph waiting to be sung


dancing shadows
